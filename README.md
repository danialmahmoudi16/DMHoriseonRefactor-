# Code Refactor Starter Code

# User Story and Acceptance Criteria
- AS A marketing agency

- SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code

- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
